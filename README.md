# 📄 AI-Powered Automated Resume Screening Tool

An industry-oriented ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Resume Screening Platform built using Python, NLP, Sentence Transformers, and Streamlit.

This project simulates how modern HR Tech platforms automatically screen, rank, and shortlist resumes based on job descriptions, required skills, semantic similarity, and AI-powered matching.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job opening. Manually reviewing each resume is time-consuming and inefficient.

This project automates the resume screening workflow by:

* Parsing resumes (PDF/DOCX/TXT)
* Extracting text and skills
* Comparing resumes with job descriptions
* Calculating ATS scores using AI semantic matching
* Identifying missing skills
* Ranking candidates automatically
* Generating downloadable reports

The system behaves like a real-world ATS platform used by HR teams and recruitment companies.
